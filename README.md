### Heyo Rutger here!👋

I'm a big tech lover, currently learning software engineering at [Codam Coding College](https://www.codam.nl/) (part of the [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/what-is-42/42-program-explained/)).


- 👨‍💻 I’m working on writing my own simple shell in C and my work as webdeveloper
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more C/C++, webdevelopment and the fundamentals of blockchain technology
- 👔 I'm working as full stack developer at the [ZuiderMrkt](https://www.zuidermrkt.nl/)
- 📚 I have an academic background in Psychology and Philosophy
- ⭐ Well known among friends for finding bugs in unexpected places (definitely never my fault though)

Currently my repositories are mostly school projects which are written in
